        <h3><b>INTRODUCTION</b></h3>
    <div style="font-size: x-large;color: aliceblue;">
        <p>
            A report on Road Accidents in India by the Indian government stated that nearly 5lakh accidents have occurred and 1.5 lakh people nearly have been passed away in road accidents and leaving about 5 lakh people injured. Alcohol was found to result to 6755 deaths annually, which are more than 18 deaths daily across the country. A study has found that vision, braking behavior and vigilance are affected greatly even with low consumption of alcohol. The methodology was developed by keeping in mind that an intoxicated person shouldn’t be able to drive a car. The system uses a MQ3 sensor to detect if the person is intoxicated with alcohol [1-4]. The analogue pin value of the MQ3 sensor is increased to decrease the sensitivity to  alcohol, so that  wrongful  detections  like  detecting  a drunken passenger while the driver is not under the influence of alcohol can be avoided. The buzzer also gets activated which alerts the driver to pull over and take a cab. The system also sends a message to the concerned regarding the condition of the driver and his location.  
The various problems have let us to think a way in which we can ensure the health of driver and safety of nearby passing vehicles, pedestrians. This research is  on the driver’s heart rate  by using  an infrared heart-rate sensor or pulse sensor [5-7]. This system consists of such an optical pulse sensor and is proposed that it is placed under the steering wheel. Whenever an appreciable change is observed in the driver’s pulse rate, an automatic message is generated along with the location to the person whose details are already saved in the system, so that the driver can get a medical care as early as possible [8-11].  Along with this, it can be integrated with the system of E-vehicles to control the voltage of the motors so that eventually the speed of the vehicles can be reduced, which if connected to the parking lights, other drivers will get conscious about the problem; hence avoiding road accident. Heart beat goes down in case of dizziness, which can be linked to an alarm, thus the driver will get a cautionary alert.       Due to delayed communication and it is shown that phone-based protocols and notifications have been proved helpful.  Inspired  by this fact,  this project  provides with  an accident detection system which detects accidents and reports it to the concerned person with location so that the help reaches the person on time. The accident detection system consists of a vibration sensor and an accelerometer. The accelerometer also consists of a gyroscope [12-15]. This gyroscope detects the change in orientation of the vehicle, giving information about sudden over turning of the vehicle. Also, the system consists of a 3-vibration sensor which detects force that the vehicle undergoes during the crash. These two sensors work together to detect the accidents and avoid false detection. The communication in this methodology done by a GSM module.
            A collision avoidance system (CAS), also called a pre-collision technology, forward-collision warning system, or collision mitigation system is sophisticated driver-assistance system that is designed to prevent or mitigate the severity of a collision. A forward-collision warning system, in its most basic form, analyzes a vehicle’s speed, the vehicle speed in front of it, and the space between the vehicles so that it can warn the driver if the cars get too close, potentially preventing a crash.Collision warning system sensors regularly review the route and transmit messages to the sensor. The sensor will analyze the data and send it to the system. From here, the system’s operation is divided into two parts: warning merely and direct control. After completing all of the car crash testings safely, the sensors are installed in new vehicles.

            <h2>Types </h2>
            Automatic braking system (AEB): An AEB is a technology that activates the vehicle’s braking system automatically when it detects an impending obstacle. Certain AEB systems will just apply a fraction of the braking power to give the driver more time to intervene, whereas other technologies will apply the brakes until the car comes to a complete stop.
            <br>
            daptive cruise control (ACC): is a technology that assists automobiles in maintaining a safe following distance while staying within the speed limit. This device automatically changes a vehicle’s speed so that drivers do not have to.
            <br>
            Electronic Stability Control: When it detects a sudden loss of control, such as traveling too rapidly around a corner, ESC automatically assists in stabilizing your vehicle. It is turned on when you start your automobile and will trigger if it thinks you are losing control.
            <br>
            Park Assist is an automatic parking aid that assists drivers in parking more precisely by utilizing guidance system technology that outperforms ultrasonic and other camera-based alternatives with superior, advanced technology. In many ways, the parking guidance system (PGS) is customer-focused. It not only gets parkers to open spaces, but it also upgrades every stage of the driving experience with automated processes that guide drivers with trust.
            <h2> Types of Alerting systems</h2>
            FCW (forward collision warning system): An FCW system is a cutting-edge safety device that monitors the speed of a vehicle, the speed of the vehicle ahead of it, and the distance between the cars. If a vehicle gets too near to another due to the speed of the back car, the FCW system will notify the driver of an impending collision.

            </div>
            Lane departure warning system: This sort of collision avoidance software is designed to inform drivers if their car begins to drift out of its lane, and it can be especially beneficial for real-time blind spot recognition.
            <br>
            Pedestrian detection system: Cyclists and pedestrians are among the most susceptible targets for automobiles, accounting for approximately a quarter of all road fatalities. A pedestrian detection system employs sensors to detect human movement on the road, such as cyclists or jaywalkers, to assist drivers in detecting a moving object before it is too late.
            <br>
            Blind Spot Warning: When a vehicle in an adjacent lane approaches the back of the car – a common blind spot location – the system alerts the driver with an indication. In this case, if the driver uses the turn signal, the system informs the driver with a chime and constantly glows the indicator light to help the driver avoid a collision.

            <h2>What are collision sensors</h2>
            <br>
            <p>A collision sensor is an electrical safety sensor that monitors an impact via vibrations. Impact sensors are another name for collision sensors. Collision sensors are utilized in a variety of industries, particularly manufacturing and utilities.</p>
            <br>
            <h2>How collision avoidance is benefitting the B2B industry?</h2>
            <p>
                Collision avoidance systems can be an excellent method to keep your fleets safe while also serving as a helpful tool for training drivers on safety best practices. 
                These monitoring systems can warn drivers of a problem before it’s too late since they use sensor technology to detect oncoming crashes. 
                Furthermore, collision avoidance systems can assist minimize the number of expensive safety-related events that occur across your fleet, which can have a substantial impact on your bottom line.</p>
