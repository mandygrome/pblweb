        <h3><b>INTRODUCTION</b></h3>
    <div style="font-size: x-large;color: aliceblue;">
        <p>
            A collision avoidance system (CAS), also called a pre-collision technology, forward-collision warning system, or collision mitigation system is sophisticated driver-assistance system that is designed to prevent or mitigate the severity of a collision. A forward-collision warning system, in its most basic form, analyzes a vehicle’s speed, the vehicle speed in front of it, and the space between the vehicles so that it can warn the driver if the cars get too close, potentially preventing a crash.Collision warning system sensors regularly review the route and transmit messages to the sensor. The sensor will analyze the data and send it to the system. From here, the system’s operation is divided into two parts: warning merely and direct control. After completing all of the car crash testings safely, the sensors are installed in new vehicles.
        </p>
            <h2>Types </h2>
            Automatic braking system (AEB): An AEB is a technology that activates the vehicle’s braking system automatically when it detects an impending obstacle. Certain AEB systems will just apply a fraction of the braking power to give the driver more time to intervene, whereas other technologies will apply the brakes until the car comes to a complete stop.
            <br>
            daptive cruise control (ACC): is a technology that assists automobiles in maintaining a safe following distance while staying within the speed limit. This device automatically changes a vehicle’s speed so that drivers do not have to.
            <br>
            Electronic Stability Control: When it detects a sudden loss of control, such as traveling too rapidly around a corner, ESC automatically assists in stabilizing your vehicle. It is turned on when you start your automobile and will trigger if it thinks you are losing control.
            <br>
            Park Assist is an automatic parking aid that assists drivers in parking more precisely by utilizing guidance system technology that outperforms ultrasonic and other camera-based alternatives with superior, advanced technology. In many ways, the parking guidance system (PGS) is customer-focused. It not only gets parkers to open spaces, but it also upgrades every stage of the driving experience with automated processes that guide drivers with trust.
            <h2> Types of Alerting systems</h2>
            FCW (forward collision warning system): An FCW system is a cutting-edge safety device that monitors the speed of a vehicle, the speed of the vehicle ahead of it, and the distance between the cars. If a vehicle gets too near to another due to the speed of the back car, the FCW system will notify the driver of an impending collision.

            </div>
            Lane departure warning system: This sort of collision avoidance software is designed to inform drivers if their car begins to drift out of its lane, and it can be especially beneficial for real-time blind spot recognition.
            <br>
            Pedestrian detection system: Cyclists and pedestrians are among the most susceptible targets for automobiles, accounting for approximately a quarter of all road fatalities. A pedestrian detection system employs sensors to detect human movement on the road, such as cyclists or jaywalkers, to assist drivers in detecting a moving object before it is too late.
            <br>
            Blind Spot Warning: When a vehicle in an adjacent lane approaches the back of the car – a common blind spot location – the system alerts the driver with an indication. In this case, if the driver uses the turn signal, the system informs the driver with a chime and constantly glows the indicator light to help the driver avoid a collision.
            <br>
            <h2>What are collision sensors</h2>
            <br>
            <p>A collision sensor is an electrical safety sensor that monitors an impact via vibrations. Impact sensors are another name for collision sensors. Collision sensors are utilized in a variety of industries, particularly manufacturing and utilities.</p>
            <br>
            <h2>How collision avoidance is benefitting the B2B industry?</h2>
            <p>
                Collision avoidance systems can be an excellent method to keep your fleets safe while also serving as a helpful tool for training drivers on safety best practices. 
                These monitoring systems can warn drivers of a problem before it’s too late since they use sensor technology to detect oncoming crashes. 
                Furthermore, collision avoidance systems can assist minimize the number of expensive safety-related events that occur across your fleet, which can have a substantial impact on your bottom line.</p>
